    "- **Barrier Presence**: A binary value indicating whether a barrier is present (True or False).\n",

    "We will follow these steps:\n",

    "   - A pre-trained model will be loaded from a specified file path to make predictions on unseen images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Processing for Inference**: \n",
    "   - The function `process_images` is defined to process all images within a directory. For each image, the model will be queried to get the predictions for fullness and barrier presence.\n",
    "   - It will also format the output by displaying each image alongside its respective predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Display Predictions**: \n",
    "   - The `display_image` function is utilized to visually present each vial image together with formatted fullness and barrier information, making it easier to review the model’s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results Compilation**: \n",
    "   - An organized list of results is compiled, containing the image name, bounding box information (fixed values in this case), and predicted attributes (fullness and barrier presence).\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Exporting Results**: \n",
    "   - Finally, results from the inference phase are saved into an Excel file for human review. The results will include the images and attributes in an easy-to-read format.\n",

    "## Data Preparation Utilities\n",
    "\n",

These utilities streamline the workflow, ensuring that input images are correctly formatted and suitable for model training.\n",

    "### Extract Health Vials from Screenshots\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, we will utilize a mask to automate the extraction of health vial images from high-resolution screenshots (1440p) of Diablo 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps involved include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Applying the Mask**: \n",
    "   - The provided mask image (`../images/health-vial-mask.1440.png`) is used to identify and isolate health vials within the screenshots. This mask effectively filters the relevant portions of the images, ensuring that only the health vial contents are extracted for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Resizing**: \n",
    "   - Once the health vial is extracted, the resulting image is resized slightly larger than the original dimensions, which helps maintain quality and clarity. A white background is used to ensure that the health vial images stand out, which is especially useful for subsequent training phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Consistency**:\n",
    "   - The extraction process ensures that all health vials are represented with a uniform size and background. This consistency is crucial for training the model, as it allows the algorithm to focus on learning the features and patterns typical of health vials without variations due to size or background distractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing these operations, we enhance the overall quality and usability of the image data, thereby improving the robustness of the machine learning model during the training process."
